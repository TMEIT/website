    SQL Alchemy model for TMEIT Members.

    TMEIT members are stored in the database by their email address. (Usually a KTH email, but this may be a Gmail
    address if they are not a KTH student)
    Members have a current role, which describes their current position in TMEIT and their website permissions.
    They can also can have a number of different roles and titles in the klubbm√§steri.
    Members can belong to many different workteams but should only be in one active workteam. Members can be given a
    nickname that they have earned, or have chosen themselves. We keep track of a member's phone number, what
    qualifications they have, and whether they are on the Kistan liquor license.
    Members can also be granted titles that represent roles that they have or special things that they have done, and
    the year that they held the role can also be recorded.
    Members may also be team leaders for the workteams they are a part of.
